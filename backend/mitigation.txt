## Mitigation Steps for Non-Compliance Audit Results:

Based on the provided audit results, the following mitigation steps are recommended:

1. Disable Kernel Modules:

 Identify and Disable: 
     cramfs: Use the appropriate command for your operating system to disable the cramfs kernel module. For example, in Linux, you can use the `modprobe -r cramfs` command.
     freevxfs: Disable the freevxfs kernel module using similar commands or configuration options.
     hfs: Disable the hfs kernel module following the same procedure. 
 Verify Removal: After disabling the modules, verify that they are no longer loaded by checking the output of the `lsmod` command (for Linux) or a similar command for your operating system.

2. Harden Kernel Configuration:

 Review and Modify: Review the kernel configuration (e.g., `CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD` in Linux) to ensure that these modules are not loaded at boot time.
 Disable Unnecessary Modules: Disable any other unnecessary kernel modules that are not required for the system's functionality. 
 Restrict Module Loading: Consider implementing stricter security measures to prevent unauthorized loading of kernel modules, such as using the `modprobe.blacklist` file or similar mechanisms.

3. Implement Security Policies:

 Access Control: Enforce access control policies to limit who can load or modify kernel modules.
 Security Monitoring: Implement security monitoring tools to detect any attempts to load or manipulate these kernel modules.

4. Update and Patch:

 Regular Updates: Ensure that the operating system and all software components are regularly updated with the latest security patches.
 Security Advisories: Keep an eye on security advisories and promptly address any vulnerabilities related to kernel modules.

5. Best Practices:

 Minimal Installation: Only install the necessary software and kernel modules for your system.
 Principle of Least Privilege: Run applications with the least privileges required for their functionality.
 Regular Audits: Conduct regular security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities and non-compliance.


Additional Considerations:

 Impact Analysis: Before implementing any mitigation steps, carefully analyze the potential impact on the system's functionality.
 Documentation: Document all changes made to the system's configuration to facilitate future audits and troubleshooting.

Note: The specific commands and procedures may vary depending on the operating system and version you are using. It is recommended to consult the documentation for your system for detailed instructions.
