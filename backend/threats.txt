## Risk and Threat Report: Non-Compliance Audit Results

Date: [Date]

Prepared by: [Your Name/Team]

Executive Summary:

This report details the findings of a non-compliance audit conducted on [Date] and identifies critical risks and threats arising from non-compliance with security benchmarks related to kernel module availability. 

Audit Scope:

The audit assessed the availability of specific kernel modules as defined by the following security benchmarks:

 Benchmark 1.1.1.1: Ensure cramfs kernel module is not available
 Benchmark 1.1.1.2: Ensure freevxfs kernel module is not available
 Benchmark 1.1.1.3: Ensure hfs kernel module is not available

Findings:

The audit revealed that all three assessed benchmarks are currently not compliant.  This indicates the presence of the following kernel modules:

 cramfs:  A file system format used for embedding files in a read-only compressed format.
 freevxfs: A virtual file system for accessing files on remote machines.
 hfs:  A file system used for accessing files on Apple Macintosh computers.

Risks and Threats:

The presence of these kernel modules presents a significant risk to the system's security and stability for the following reasons:

 Potential for Exploitation:  These modules could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system.
 System Instability:  Outdated or incompatible kernel modules can cause system instability and crashes.
 Security Vulnerabilities:  These kernel modules may contain known security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.
 Data Loss:  Unauthorized access to sensitive data through these modules could result in data loss or corruption.

Recommendations:

To mitigate the identified risks and threats, the following actions are strongly recommended:

1. Immediate Removal of Kernel Modules:  Remove the cramfs, freevxfs, and hfs kernel modules from the system immediately. This can be done through system configuration tools or by modifying the kernel configuration file.
2. Kernel Security Audit:  Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the kernel to identify and address any other vulnerabilities or non-compliant configurations.
3. Regular Security Updates:  Implement a schedule for regular security updates to ensure that all system components, including the kernel, are patched against known vulnerabilities.
4. System Monitoring and Logging:  Implement robust system monitoring and logging to detect any suspicious activity related to kernel modules.
5. Security Training:  Provide security training to system administrators on the importance of kernel security and best practices for maintaining a secure system.

Conclusion:

The non-compliance with security benchmarks related to kernel module availability represents a significant security threat.  Implementing the recommended actions is critical to mitigate these risks and ensure the security and stability of the system.  Failure to do so could result in serious security breaches, system instability, and data loss.
